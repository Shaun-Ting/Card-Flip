# Card-Flip
This is my repository for my card flip project in my linear data structures course

Project info:
Assume you have a set of cards laid out in an n by m grid (n rows of m columns each). Some are face up, and others are face down. We can collapse the grid into a single pile by using a series of flips (Top, Bottom, Left, Right). The user determines the grid size, and flips. The output will be all the face down cards.
